## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods into programmable units (such as a class). It lets you restrict access to some components of an object, so users cannot directly access state values for all of the variables of a particular object, this is referred to as *information hiding*.

### Getters and setters methods.
Getters (accessors) and setters (mutators) are class functions that act as an intermediate interface to respectively fetch and manipulate the state of an object. This lets you control *how* data is accessed or manipulated, by enforcing validation checks or restrictions, for example. They also improve maintainability, since any future change in internal class representation may be handled by changing getter and setter functions instead of the code that uses them.

Getters are usually declared as const member functions, which guarantees they will not modify the state of the object on which it is called, therefore providing read-only access to data.

## [Parametric manipulators](https://cplusplus.com/reference/iomanip/)

Stream manipulators that take parameters to modify the behaviour of the input/output streams.
- `/*undefined*/ setw (int n)`: Sets the field width to be used on output operations.
