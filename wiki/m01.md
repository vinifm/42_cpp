## Orthodox Canonical Class Form
The Orthodox Canonical Form consists of:
- Default constructor: A default constructor is a constructor that either has no parameters, or if it has parameters, all the parameters have default values.
- Copy constructor: a constructor which creates a new object by initializing it with an object of the same class, which has been created previously. If a copy constructor is not defined in a class, the compiler itself defines one. If the class has pointer variables and has some dynamic memory allocations, then it is a must to have a copy constructor. Its parameter is a reference to an object of the same class declared as const to ensure it will not modify the object being copied.

- Copy assignment operator: assigns the values of an object to a pre-existing one, overloading its values. ([Copy Constructor vs Assignment Operator in C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-constructor-vs-assignment-operator-in-c/))
- Destructor.
